# Review Gaps



## Backlog

- Verify the `viewport-animate.ts` root margin (200px) during a future animation tuning pass to ensure it behaves well across layout variants.
- Consolidate feature-specific API helpers (`social.ts`, `prologueApi.ts`, `mythacoin.ts`) onto the shared `fetchJson` wrapper to reduce duplication.
- Add Supabase auth error-path tests (sign-in/sign-up) to confirm user-facing feedback remains clear.
- Extend unit coverage for `fetchJson` to exercise network and timeout error branches.
- Document backend setup via script or container workflow to make onboarding repeatable.



## Done

- Batch 0 — Setup complete.
