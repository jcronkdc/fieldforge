# Review Cycle Summary

- **Date:** 2025-11-10
- **Batches completed:** 10 primary batches + Final audit + Batch 15 backlog grooming + Nanosteps 1–4
- **Status:** ✅ Review cycle complete, backlog frozen for next planning session

## Quality Outcomes

- TypeScript type-check, lint suites (`lint:ui-copy`, `lint:media`, `lint:copy`, `lint:backlog`), Vitest smoke tests, and Vite production build all pass.
- Backlog captured with owners, priority, cycle targets, and dependencies; automation guard ensures metadata completeness.
- No unresolved console output or placeholder copy in production surface; performance warnings reduced to informational notes (e.g., Vite dynamic import notices).

## Next Actions

- Follow backlog items recorded in `docs/review/GAPS.md`.
- Prepare scheduling and resourcing for the next planning session (cycle Q1/Q2 targets).
