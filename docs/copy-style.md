# FieldForge Copy Style Guidelines

- Use sentence case for all headings, buttons, links, and navigation labels. Example: “View details”.
- Keep the tone concise, professional, and neutral. Avoid marketing fluff or hype.
- Avoid exclamation points in UI copy.
- Prefer direct nouns over second-person phrasing. Example: “Project created.” instead of “You created a project.”
- Call-to-action text stays within 2–3 words. Recommended set: “Get started”, “View details”, “Learn more”, “Save”, “Cancel”.
- Error copy states the issue and the next step. Example: “Upload failed. Try again.”
- Tooltip copy is a single sentence under ~90 characters.
- Never use literal ellipses (“…”). Finish sentences with a period when needed.
## FieldForge Copy Style Guidelines

- **Sentence case** for headings, buttons, and navigation. Example: `View details`, not `View Details`.
- **No exclamation points** or hype language; keep tone concise, professional, neutral.
- Use **second person sparingly**. Prefer statements like `Project created.` over `You created a project.` unless clarity requires it.
- **CTA copy** stays short (2–3 words): `Get started`, `View details`, `Try demo`, `Save`, `Cancel`.
- **Error messages** follow the `Problem. Action.` pattern. Example: `Upload failed. Try again.`
- **Tooltips** are a single sentence under ~90 characters.
- **No ellipses** as placeholders. Finish the sentence or remove it.
