## 📋 Manual Demo Account Creation (if needed)

If the demo account doesn't exist yet, create it in Supabase:

### Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lzfzkrylexsarpxypktt/auth/users
2. Click **Add user** → **Create new user**
3. Enter:
   - Email: `demo@fieldforge.com`
   - Password: `FieldForge2025!Demo`
   - ✅ Auto Confirm Email (check this)
4. Click **Create user**

### Option 2: Via SQL Editor

Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create demo user (run this as a one-time setup)
DO $$
DECLARE
  demo_user_id UUID;
BEGIN
  -- Create auth user via Supabase dashboard first, then run this to set up profile
  
  -- Get the demo user ID (after creating via dashboard)
  SELECT id INTO demo_user_id 
  FROM auth.users 
  WHERE email = 'demo@fieldforge.com'
  LIMIT 1;
  
  IF demo_user_id IS NOT NULL THEN
    -- Create or update user profile
    INSERT INTO user_profiles (
      id,
      email,
      first_name,
      last_name,
      job_title,
      phone,
      company_id
    )
    VALUES (
      demo_user_id,
      'demo@fieldforge.com',
      'Demo',
      'User',
      'Project Manager',
      '555-0100',
      (SELECT id FROM companies WHERE name = 'Demo Electric Co' LIMIT 1)
    )
    ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE
    SET 
      first_name = 'Demo',
      last_name = 'User',
      job_title = 'Project Manager',
      updated_at = now();
    
    -- Add to demo project
    INSERT INTO project_team (
      project_id,
      user_id,
      role,
      company_id,
      start_date
    )
    SELECT 
      p.id,
      demo_user_id,
      'project_manager',
      c.id,
      CURRENT_DATE
    FROM projects p
    JOIN companies c ON c.id = p.company_id
    WHERE p.project_number = 'DEMO-001'
    ON CONFLICT (project_id, user_id) DO NOTHING;
    
    RAISE NOTICE 'Demo user profile created successfully';
  ELSE
    RAISE NOTICE 'Demo user not found. Please create via Supabase dashboard first.';
  END IF;
END $$;
```
